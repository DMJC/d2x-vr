D2X-XL version from SVN (2021-04-11) with a few stability and build fixes applied.

Building on linux requires the following libraries: SDL 1.2, SDL-mixer 1.2, SDL-net 1.2, GLEW and libcurl.

To build on debian/ubuntu, use the following command to install all required packages:
sudo apt install build-essential automake autoconf libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev libglew-dev libcurl3-dev

You can then build it with the following commands:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

You can run a minimal version with just the following Descent 2 data files (must be lower case filenames):
alien1.pig alien2.pig fire.pig groupa.pig ice.pig water.pig descent2.hog descent2.ham descent2.s11 descent2.s22

Specify the directory with these files with the -datadir argument:
./d2x-xl -datadir ~/data/d2

D2X-XL will copy the data files to a data/ subdirectory and create a few other subdirectories there.

For a more complete version follow the original installation guide:
